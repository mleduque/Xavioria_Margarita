COPYRIGHT: Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition is made by Beamdog, and 
this mod was unable to be developed without material used from 
BG:EE

This is my first mod ever, and NPC mod, which includes:

- Margarita Zelleod!!
- A new Ranger (Stalker) NPC for Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition
- Two seperate ending paths depending on your reaction to the NPC
- Banters with Some original Bioware NPCs
- Interjections on certain quests

This is mod is (currently) only for PC and BG:EE, unfortunately I 
have no way of testing it for MAC or for the original BG1 Tutu or 
BGT so I apologeize ahead of time. A Neutral Halfling Stalker sounds 
somewhat like a stretch, however; I have done what I can to make 
something new, refreshing, seemless and interesting into a game I 
love and hope that those that try it will like it too.

To Install:

After download, just extract the contents of the .RAR file into your 
BG:EE directory (usually looks like this: C:\Program Files\Baldur's 
Gate Enhanced Edition\Data\00766). Then, just run the Setup-Margarita.exe 
file and follow the instructions. Should only take a couple of seconds!

Compatibility:

I have not tried this with any other mods, but from my understanding, this 
mod should be compatible with most other, if not all other mods.
AGAIN: Only for PC and BG:EE!!

Major Details:

Margarita Zelleod

Margarita is a young Halfling that seems to be traveling the sword coast, although 
it is obvious she isn't quite from around there. She's defensive, quiet, and prone 
to sarcasm when pushed or confronted. She likes to come off as useless, timid, or 
otherwise innocent, even if that isn't quite the case. Her main belief is: Honor Thy 
Employer. She does whatever is in her power to complete her employer's tasks, asks no 
questions except: "How much will I be paid." She is intelligent enough however to see 
if her life is endangered, and will not endanger it if she can help it (At this case, the 
price becomes too high). 

Statistics:
- Strength     15
- Dexterity    17
- Constitution 15
- Intelligence 12
- Wisdom       14
- Charisma     15

In-Game Details:
- Margarita is available INSIDE the Nashkel Mines. She is not in the general area, she is 
actually INSIDE the mines.
- She comes at level 2, she can be found fairly early, but early adventuring might put her 
a bit behind you, therefore you may want to pick her up early if you want things to stay 
even. She will not leave the party unless you force her out.
- NOTE: Unfortunately she does not have original voicing or Portrait yet. I have been unable 
to find any help regarding either, and I am not very good with photoshop (yet anyways) and 
original portraits and voice will not exist until a future release.

I would just like to say thank you to all of those who were able to help me along this entire 
process, this including "Kulyok" and "K'aeloree" who were very helpful, as well as "Wisp" 
for helping me with Weidu!
